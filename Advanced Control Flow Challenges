# This file contains intermediate-level Python exercises focused on control flow and conditional logic. Challenges include comparing values, logical contradictions, nested conditions, and custom decision-making.


#Q1 Create a function named same_name() that has two parameters named your_name and my_name. If our names are identical, return True. Otherwise, return False.

def same_name(your_name, my_name):
  if your_name == my_name:
    return True
  return False

print(same_name("Colby", "Colby"))
print(same_name("Tina", "Amber"))

#Q2) Create a function named in_range() that has three parameters named num, lower, and upper. The function should return True if num is greater than or equal to lower and less than or equal to upper. Otherwise, return False.

def in_range(num, lower, upper):
  if(num >= lower and num <= upper):
    return True
  else:
    return False

print(in_range(10, 10, 10))
print(in_range(5, 10, 20))

#Q3) Create a function named always_false() that has one parameter named num. Using an if statement, your variable num, and the operators >, and <, make it so your function will return False no matter what number is stored in num. An if statement that is always false is called a contradiction. You will rarely want to do this while programming, but it is important to realize it is possible to do this.

def always_false(num):
  if num > 1 and num < 1:
    return True
  return False

print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False

#Q4) Create a function named movie_review() that has one parameter named rating. If rating is less than or equal to 5, return "Avoid at all costs!". If rating is between 5 and 9, return "This one was fun.". If rating is 9 or above, return "Outstanding!"

def movie_review(rating):
  if rating <= 5:
    return "Avoid at all costs!"
  if rating < 9:
    return "This one was fun."
  return "Outstanding!"

print(movie_review(9))
# should print "Outstanding!"
print(movie_review(4))
# should print "Avoid at all costs!"
print(movie_review(6))
# should print "This one was fun."

#Q5) Create a function called max_num() that has three parameters named num1, num2, and num3. The function should return the largest of these three numbers. If any of two numbers tie as the largest, you should return "It's a tie!".

def max_num(num1, num2, num3):
  if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
    return num1
  elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
    return num2
  elif num3 > num1 and num3 > num2:
    return num3
  else:
    return "It's a tie!"

print(max_num(-10, 0, 10))
# should print 10
print(max_num(-10, 5, -30))
# should print 5
print(max_num(-5, -10, -10))
# should print -5
print(max_num(2, 3, 3))
# should print "It's a tie!"
