#================================
print()
print("Section 1.0 - Intro To Python")
#Section 1.0 - Hello World
'''
Here is an intro to python! I hope you learn and start coding.
'''



#================================
print()
print("Section 1.1 - Hello World")
#Section 1.1 - Hello World
'''
Printing is outputting a message to the terminal where a
user can see.

The code below prints Hello World! to the terminal.
'''

print("Hello World!")




#================================
print()
print("Section 1.2 - Comments")
#Section 1.2 - Comments
'''
Comments allow developers to store notes within their code for
themselves or other developers to see.
'''




#================================
print()
print("Section 1.3 - Strings")
#Section 1.3 - Strings
'''
Strings are blocks of text. In 1.1, we printed a string that printed
out 'Hello World'.

Strings can use single or double quotation marks, just make sure that
they correspond
'''

name = "John"

day = 'saturday'




#================================
print()
print("Section 1.4 - Variables")
#Section 1.4 - Variables
'''
Variables are a way to store data to be resued while coding. Variables
can store different types of information and they can be updated throughout
your code.

To create a variable, you need to name it and then use '=' next to it's
value.

In Python, it's common practice to use 'snake case'. Snake case means
placing a '_' inbetween each word instead of a space.
'''

my_meal = "Fruit & Water"

print("Breakfast...")
print(my_meal)

my_meal = "Shrimp Fried Rice"

print("Lunch...")
print(my_meal)

my_meal = "Steak & Potatoes"

print("Dinner")
print(my_meal)



#================================
print()
print("Section 1.5 - Errors")
#Section 1.5 - Errors
'''
I have never ran a program I was creating and it contained no errors. Even
as something as simple as a comma can stop your program from working.

One of the most common errors are Syntax Errors. this occirs when the
puncuation of your code contains an error.
'''




#================================
print()
print("Section 1.6 - Numbers")
#Section 1.6 - Numbers
'''
This shouldnt be a suprise, of course there are numbers in coding! However,
there are two types dedicated to numbers - floats and intergers. An integer
are numbers like 1, 2000, and 1000000000. Floats on the other hand are decimal
numbers.

This (1000000000) number is hard to read but there is a solution - underscores.
They print the same number with or without and look like... 1_000_000_000.
'''

coin_name = 'Bitcoin'
coin_price = 50_000
coin_number = 21_000_000


my_wallet = 1
my_balance = my_wallet * coin_price

print(my_balance)




#================================
print()
print("Section 2.0 - Control Flow")
#Section 1.1 - Hello World
'''
Control Flow is the process of making decisons through yes and no arguments. For
example, lets say you are about to go out. If it was Sunday, you may say you need to
your suit for church. If it was Monday, you may say you need to go to work or school
and grab your bag on your way out and check for nay assignemnts. If it was saturday
or a holida, you may not need to do anything when you wake up.

This is an example of a control flow. Another example is order of operations.
'''


#================================
print()
print("Section 2.1 - Boolean Expressions")
#Section 2.1 - Boolean Expressions
'''
Boolean expressions refer to true and false statements. It is important to make sure that
boolean statements refer to a statement and not an opinion.
'''


#================================
print()
print("Section 2.2 - Relational Operations: Equals and Not Equals")
#Section 2.2 - Relational Operations: Equals and Not Equals
'''
Printing is outputting a message to the terminal where a
user can see.

The code below prints Hello World! to the terminal.
'''

print("Hello World!")
