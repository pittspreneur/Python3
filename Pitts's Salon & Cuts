#Here, we are calculating metrics based on three lists that contain both string and integer data. We take the data given and determine the average haircut price, total revenue, and use list comprehension to determine other statistics.

hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

#Creating total price
total_price = 0 
for price in prices:
  total_price += price

#Finding the average sales price
average_price = total_price / len(prices)
print("Avergae Haircut Price: " + str(average_price))

#New price list comprehension
new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]
print(new_prices)

#Calculating Revenue
total_revenue = 0
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]

print("Total Revenue: $" + str(total_revenue))

average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7

#List Compensation
cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(prices)) if prices[i] < 30]
print(cuts_under_30)
