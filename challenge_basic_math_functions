# This file contains beginner-level math challenges that reinforce basic arithmetic operations and function creation.
# Tasks include exponentiation, square roots, percentages, averages, and applying custom formulas with division and modulus.


#Q1) Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num. The function should return num raised to the 10th power.

def tenth_power(num):
  return num ** 10

print(tenth_power(1))
# 1 to the 10th power is 1
print(tenth_power(0))
# 0 to the 10th power is 0
print(tenth_power(2))
# 2 to the 10th power is 1024


#__________________________

#Q2) Write a function named square_root() that has one parameter named num. Use exponents (**) to return the square root of num.

def square_root(num):
  return num ** .5

print(square_root(16))
# should print 4
print(square_root(100))
# should print 10

#__________________________

#Q3) Create a function called win_percentage() that takes two parameters named wins and losses. This function should return out the total percentage of games won by a team based on these two numbers.

def win_percentage(wins, losses):
  return (wins / (wins + losses)) * 100

print(win_percentage(5, 5))
# should print 50
print(win_percentage(10, 0))
# should print 100

#__________________________

#Q4) Write a function named average() that has two parameters named num1 and num2. The function should return the average of these two numbers.

def average(num1, num2):
  return (num1 + num2) / 2

print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0

#__________________________

#Q5) Write a function named remainder() that has two parameters named num1 and num2. The function should return the remainder of twice num1 divided by half of num2. 

def remainder(num1, num2):
  first = num1 * 2
  second = num2 / 2
  return first % second
  
print(remainder(15, 14))
# should print 2
print(remainder(9, 6))
# should print 0
